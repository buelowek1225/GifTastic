Title: GifTastic

Created by: Ellen Buelow

Goal of this webpage: The goal of this webpage was to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the user's choice of animals. 

Instructions: Using the search window enter the animal you would like to search or you can use one of the buttons already generated. Once you have either chosen a button or created a button, hover your mouse over the button and 'click' to generate the animal related Gifs.

Aspects I struggled to create:

I should have spent more time learning about the API before I began. Partway through I had to go back and re-read and learn the search or 'Get' request format.

Most of my problems originated from issues with the scope of how I set up my functions and/or if/then statements.

The in class assignments helped provide alot of direction with this assignment.
